# RAML Tutorial

> This repository contains the content for the RAML tutorial on raml.org.

## RAML Specification Version

Currently the tutorial only covers the previous RAML specification version 0.8.

## Roadmap

As RAML 1.0 has been released a couple of weeks ago we plan to update the tutorial appropriately. Currently we execute a feedback round to
understand what we need to improve in general before we start with the update. We want to make sure that support and help you get from this tutorial matches to people from no to advanced experience with RAML.

## Contribution

The RAML tutorial is an open source project and your contribution is very much appreciated.

1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around an idea for extending the content or any text errors.
2. Fork the repository on Github and make your changes on an individual branch.
3. Send a pull request (with the `develop` branch as the target).

Please always work on branches and create pull requests, which then get reviewed. New content inside the `master` branch is in a production stage which will be automatically consumed and published to raml.org. Therefore, never commit anything to master directly.

A big thank you goes out to everyone who helps, the contributors and everyone who took the time to report issues and give feedback.
