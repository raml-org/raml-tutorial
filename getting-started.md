## Getting Started

RAML is a modeling language for Web/HTTP APIs that introduces unique features like fragments, small snippets of your specification, or patterns that you can use to define common structures; all externalizable and reuseable with the single goal to create succinct and concise API specifications.

This section gives you a overview how to get up and running with RAML in minutes. You will be able to initialize a small API specification, make changes, validate those, and expose a mocking service based on your specification.

Following the guide, you only need to install our official [raml-cli](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-cli) tool, a handy command-line tool that makes working with RAML even more easier.

### Install raml-cli

You can install the command-line tool using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
npm install -g raml-cli
```

Now, let's see if we can run it. Simply type in `raml --help` into your command line and you should get a description of the tool if installing was successful.
